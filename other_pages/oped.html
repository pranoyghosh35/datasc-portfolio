    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <b><i>I am going to remember the year 2023 as the year of ChatGPT! Reaching 100 million users by January, it is the fastest-growing consumer application to date, and the great cause that persuaded me to upskill myself in the field of AI-ML-Data Science taking a year-long hiatus from my software engineering career and coming to Plaksha Tech Leaders Fellowship Class of 2024.</b> By March 14, GPT-4 was there which allowed users who would pay to upload multi-modal files (documents, images, videos) and now we enjoy GPT-4 omni free. The other big players such as Microsoft, Google, and Meta played a catchup game with their models like Copilot, Gemini, and Imagine in 2023. It should be clear we have entered the age of Generative AI!</i> In this section, let me define Generative AI and its impact for you:
    </p>
    <div class="quotation-box">
        <p>
            "Generative AI is a powerful tool for streamlining the workflow of creatives, engineers, researchers, scientists, and more. The use cases and possibilities span all industries and individuals. Generative AI models can take inputs such as text, image, audio, video, and code and generate new content into any of the modalities mentioned. For example, it can turn text inputs into an image, turn an image into a song, or turn video into text."
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Practically, we now have <b><i> the magic wand to generate our ideas in the style of legendary artists ranging in likes from (painting) Van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci, (music) RD Burman, Kishore Kumar to (literature) JK Rowling.</b></i> That raises the question:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            With Generative AI, would we struggle defining who is the artist and what is an art?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The modern definition of art is not restrictive to being aesthetically pleasant, and AI is the tool in the hands of a human visionary who may merely be lacking the traditional skills to execute it. Hence it should democratize artforms.</b> Moreover, this debate of whether AI technology-generated piece of work can be considered an art form is similar in nature to whether photographs can be an art form, and we have generally accepted the latter; as photographs not merely come from the camera but incorporate diligent planning and effort to capture a scene that tells a story. Nonetheless, more and more competitions and exhibitions are allowing entry of art made by AI alongside those added traditionally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notable examples of AI-generated art exhibited alongside human art include <b><i> Refik Anadol’s immersive installation at the Venice Biennale in 2023, which used AI to create dynamic simulations and interactive sculptures. Artists like Sougwen Chung collaborate with AI to blend human creativity with machine intelligence, showcasing their work in renowned galleries like the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Similarly, Hito Steyerl, Ian Cheng, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Anna Ridler utilize AI to explore various themes and create artworks exhibited in prominent institutions globally.</b> As AI continues to evolve, the distinction between human and machine-generated art will become increasingly blurred.</i>

    <h2>Conclusion: Beware of Deepfakes though</h2>
    <p>
        <b> Deep Fakes are synthetic media created using AI to fabricate realistic videos, images, or audio of individuals. This technology poses a significant threat, enabling the creation of highly realistic fabricated content that is difficult to distinguish from genuine media. Their prevalence on social media facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation, manipulating public opinion and creating false narratives.</b> Despite advances in detection techniques, such as AI-based algorithms and forensic analysis, these measures must continually evolve to keep pace with the sophistication of deep fakes. The impact on public trust is profound, as deep fakes erode confidence in media and information sources, making it harder for people to discern truth from falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
        The societal implications are <b><i> far-reaching, affecting journalism, politics, privacy, and social dynamics. Strategies to mitigate these adverse effects include collaborative efforts among stakeholders, enhanced public education, stringent platform policies, and robust legal frameworks. Technological innovations must be prioritized to develop more effective detection and prevention tools.</b></i> Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research and a collective commitment to preserving the integrity of digital content and maintaining trust in our information ecosystems.
