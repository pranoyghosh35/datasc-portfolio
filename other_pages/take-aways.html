                <h2>Discovery of passion, strengths and talents</h2>
                <p>By the grace of "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwight-jaggard-92b89/">Prof. Dwight's</a> Foundation-of-Leadership" I got to discover who I am and who I want to be. Through a scientific process I learnt my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pranoy-ghosh-202706172_talents-activity-7107128263197523970-6s-h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">many strengths and some weakness</a> and this self-discovery will always allow me to fit in better within a team.
                <br><br>
                Also I am thankful to the many mentorship sessions as I interacted with people at CXO levels, I could sneek-peek into the kind of self-discipline required to be in a position of responsibility. I realized that I had every wrong glorified ideas about entrepreneurs & why to become one - they're never boss and they're not free birds! I am especially indebted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shridhar-marri-233a02b/">Mr. Shridhar Marri</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jochenjaser/">Mr. Jochen Jaser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayahangal/">Mrs Jaya Hangal</a> interacting with them taught me :
  all the 3 bad reasons to be entrepreurs and all the right reasons, whether to do a job or venture into entrepreneurship, whom to be cofounders with, how to grow in one's career in MNC starting from entry to mid level and beyond, how career growth in MNCs vs startups look like and to chase "work-life  integrity" instead of popular idea "work-life balance"  etc etc.

    <li>Crop Classification in context of "Precision Agriculture" will revolutionize Yield Estimation, Resource (water, fertilizers, pesticides) Optimization, Improved Crop Rotation Planning and Food Security.</li>
<br>    
    <li>Time-series Satellite data is not our typical Computer Vision Dataset! because of different datasets having different resolutions, sparse quality, insufficient labelled data - we literature reviewed to choose from CNNs, Vision Transformers to finally settle on <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/76986" target="_blank">Presto</a> (<cite>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14065</cite>), a pixel series model with encoder-decoder.</li>
<br>
    <li>This work in progress aimed to revolutionize precision agriculture for Indian agricultural lands by pretraining Presto on median <a href="https://www.planet.com/" target="_blank">Planet</a> images  over all states/union territories for all months. Then that model will be fine-tuned for specific (downstream) tasks. In our project we demonstrated the feasibility by downloading only data for 4 states (Goa, Delhi, Kerala and Assam) and finetuned for just crop classification...</li>
